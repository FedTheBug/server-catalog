# server-catalog
Server Catalog made for a part of Leaseweb Technical Assessment.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Go 1.18 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Make (for using Makefile commands)

## ⚠️ Port Requirements

Before running the application, ensure that:
- Port 3306 is available for MySQL database
- Port 8080 is available for the API server

### Port 3306
The MySQL database runs on port 3306 inside the Docker container. This port must be free on your system. If you have another MySQL instance running, you'll need to stop it first.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:FedTheBug/server-catalog.git
cd server-catalog
```

2. Start the application:
```bash
make build-run
```
